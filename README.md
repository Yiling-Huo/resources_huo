Scripts and resorces that I have created or modified. 

**Praat_scripts:**
  - Add_silence_using_textgrids:
    a praat script that adds silence between each uniquely named textgrid interval according to the stimuli onset asynchrony. If dealing with speech stimuli, there is also an option to add punctuation.
